Welcome to IrisOS-nano! If you see this,
you've loaded the root filesystem succesfully.

This project is a work in progress, and so are
the contents of this filesystem. It contains
a variety of information about me, as well as
some things I find interesting. In the future,
you'll also be able to run scripts and even
programs off this filesystem.

IrisOS-nano is UNIX-like. This means some commands
may not work as expected, and this is not
feature-complete. You may also experience
bugs and crashes; if you do, please report them
on GitHub!

Have fun! :)
